# rustnote

In Spring 2019 I gave a presentation on Rust. This repo contains a w-i-p of learning the language based on the material printed within the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

### Pre-requisites

- Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) on your system
- Install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) on your system

### Build

```
make build
```
